# Gamemode ideas:

## Cops and :

* If a gendarme touches the robber, he gets teleported to the prison.
* The prison can be opened or despawned by the robbers via a P-switch so that the prisoners can  .

### Features

* possibly custom costumes or already in game outfits for robbers and gendarmes that change  


## 15 counts 

* Everyone hides
* The catcher is then allowed to move only slightly. (Per dive)
* After the seeker has completed the dives and presses a button, their screen turns black or goes into snapshot mode
* Then the hiders have a certain time to touch the seeker and then have to hide again
* After the time, the seeker will be taken out of the snapshot mode or the black screen
* Time becomes less each time

### Features
* You can adjust the time individually in the ingame menu or in the server.


## Collect the same moons like the parrot run
